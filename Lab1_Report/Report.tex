\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
This main focus for this laboratory was to create a methodology to perform operations on multidimensional arrays of varying size. The exercise makes use of the C programming language to create three procedures that operate on K dimensional arrays with an N time complexity. These three procedures take as input; a K dimensional integral array, the dimensional bounds of that array and an integer for the total number of dimensions within the array. The purpose of the procedures are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set all elements in the array to zero.
\item Set ten percent of the elements in the array uniformly to one.
\item Select five percent of the elements in the array and then display their coordinates and value.
\end{enumerate} 
Additionally a main program is written to create four arrays, the procedures that are developed are run on each of these arrays.
 
\section{Problem Solution}
This problem was solved by operating on a one dimensional array which is mathematically manipulated to act as a multidimensional array.  The array is created by allocating the equivalent memory required for the two dimensional array. The procedures are designed to take the one dimensional array as input and operate on it accordingly. 

\subsection{Procedure 1}
Procedure one uses a standard loop to iterate through each element of the array and then sets the specific element to zero.

\subsection{Procedure 2}
Procedure two determines ten percent of the total elements of the array, this number is rounded off if it is a fraction. A loop is then used to
